    <h1>Chad's Personal Statement</h1>
 </body>
While my website design will not win any awards for most well put together or most extravigent, I am proud to say that I feel I made a lot of strides with the material in this semester. I've always been someone who has struggled with the more advanced form of technology and have never truly been tech savy, so this was a struggle for me throughout but I think it's safe to say that I have a lot more knowledge of the material as a whole and could not have put this website together even this nice a couple of months ago. One thing I wanted to note was the differing color schemes on my pages. I felt that while it would look better if all pages were in the same tone, it never felt right to have the golf course themed page on the same color palet as the others. I wanted to use that page in particular to bring to life the bright and upbeat patterns that could corolate with outdoor activity. I enjoyed getting to mess around with the different design schmes for the background of that page, and while I struggled to get a lot of the creative aspects of my page to come together, that part to me came out clean.
