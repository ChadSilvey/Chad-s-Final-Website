     <h2>Get Rich Or Die Tryin' by 50 Cent</h2>
     <img src="img/50Cent.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="200">
     <p>Get Rich or Die Tryin’ is a 2005 album produced and performed by artist 50 Cent. The album was Cent’s coming out party as a musician and made him one of the most popular performers of the 2000’s</p>
     <h2>The Marshall Mathers LP by Eminem</h2>
     <img src="img/Eminem.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="200">
     <p>Considered one of the most polarizing artists of his generation, Marshall Mathers (Eminem) ushered in some of the most well known albums of the 2000’s and even had a movie made about his life as an up and coming rapper that he also starred in. Eminem’s original LP debuted in 2000 and was the first of many successful albums released by Mathers. </p>
     <h2>Tha Carter III by Lil Wayne</h2>
          <img src="img/WayneCover.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="200">
     <p>Lil Wayne produced five ‘Tha Carter’ albums, with this rendition dropping in 2008 and being well-considered as the best and most inspirational of all Wayne’s albums. </p>
     <h2>The Black Album by Jay-Z</h2>
               <img src="img/JayZCover.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="200">
     <p>Jay-Z is considered to be the most popular rapper of the 2000’s, though some of that credibility stands on the grounds of his marriage to Beyonce. He brought the rap game into the 2000’s with this stand-alone award winning album and went on to build a highly successful solo career that began with the success he made here. 
</p>
<h2>The Documentary by The Game</h2>
     <img src="img/TheGameCover.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="200">
<p>While The Game is one of the lesser known artists to crack this list, his album ‘The Documentary’ debuted in 2005 and pretty much made most of his career. While he never made another album that had the same critical success as this one, the popularity that sprang from this album made The Game a memorable name moving forward no matter what. 
</p>
<h2>Let's Get It by Young Jeezy</h2>
     <img src="img/YoungJeezyCover.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="200">
<p>Young Jeezy can credit a lot of his success to his work as a songwriter for other artists as well as performing with other artists, but Let’s Get It was his claim to fame in the 2000’s. Credited with being a good pregame album for athletes, Young Jeezy worked a lot with fellow popular artist Akon to create one of the strongest albums of the decade. 
</p>
<h2>Stankonia by Outkast</h2>
     <img src="img/OutkastCover.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="200" height="200">
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxAiK6VnXw"> 
                <span >Hit of the Decade </span>
            </a>
        </div>
<p>While there will be controversy forever over which of Outkast’s two early 2000’s albums were better, it’s Stankonia that gets the nod on this list due to the overwhelming popularity of the albums top song, Ms. Jackson. Though the album came out back in 2000, Ms. Jackson still stands today as one of the most well-known songs in the country.
